# LES-Farming-Database
Low Effort Suburban (LES) Farming Database

## Mission
Grow all the food you require in a suburban garden while spending the least time possible tending to it<br />
Grow food cheaper than supermarket and payback the capital costs of the farm within 3 years<br />
Reduce the risk of reduced/lost production through organic and passive solutions (e.g. insects and physical barriers).<br />
Low set-up, labour and maintenace costs<br />
Improve the yields by through effective garden planning and reduce the land required 100% of your food<br />
Develop modular and scalable equipment and farming plans<br />
Promote evidence based nutrition<br />
Growing enough food to meet the requirements of an evidence based whole food plant based diet<br />
